    "\n",
    "Loading data from the eo2cube requires a data query command that specifies what kind of data (what) and for which area of interest (AOI) (where) and time (when) the specified data should be loaded. Each loading query returns a multi-dimensional `xarray` object containing the contents of your query.\n",
    "For the work with the data in eo2cube environement, it is essential to understand the `xarray` data structures as they are fundamental to the structure of the stored and loaded data. Any kind of further geospatial analysis builds on this `xarray` structur.\n",

    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to load data from the eo2cube datacube by using the `dc.load()` function. It also includes the construction of a query to define the data according to desired parameters. Topics covered include:\n",
